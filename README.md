# Packboiler Template

This is a template repository to use for creating modpacks using Packboiler.

## Usage

The `template/template.hjson` contains the basic structure for your modpack. It imports the current `templates/forge/20.1-curseforge.hjson` from Packboiler's Git repo and builds off of that.

## License(?)

Absolutely everything here is public domain. It's a template and the scripts are dead simple; why would I ever need to license it?
